# DCIT_205_IA

## Introduction

This project is my DCIT205 IA which is to create a simple 10-page website that is user-friendly and navigable. My project was mainly based on HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript. The website is a very basic one which I intend on improving overtime as I improve my skills. The website allows users to view details about the Computer Science department of the University of Ghana, reach out to the department as well as receive updates from the department.

###### What I Have Learned From The Project

Working on this project has allowed me to properly understand Git and GitHub to begin with and also apply my understanding of it in the project. Also, this project has allowed me learn how to debug and fix problems. I have learned to structure my code well and also do research to be able to perform certain tasks. I have been able to revise and improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS during the entire process of working on this project. I have also learnt to reach out to other people for help when I face certain peculiar challenges.
